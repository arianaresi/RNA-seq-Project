## **Susceptibility of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia to STAT3 inhibition depends on p53 induction: resume of abstract**

Advancements in pediatric B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) treatment have improved outcomes, but relapsed cases remain challenging. 
Our research shows that inhibiting STAT3 induces p53, reversing resistance in TP53 knockout cells. 
Patient-derived samples reveal sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition, especially in TP53 wild-type cases. 
Combining STAT3 and MDM2 inhibition exhibits synergistic anti-leukemia effects, suggesting a promising therapy for refractory and relapsed pediatric B-ALL.

### **Acute lymphoblastic leukemia**

Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a *type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow* (the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made).

**Where:**

*Acute:* comes from the fact that the disease progresses rapidly and creates immature blood cells, rather than mature ones.

*Lymphocytic:* refers to the white blood cells called lymphocytes, which ALL affects. 

Acute lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and treatments result in a good chance for a cure. 


### **Causes of ALL**

According to Mayo Clinic, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia occurs when a bone marrow cell develops changes (mutations) in its genetic material or DNA. 

The mutations tell the bone marrow cell to continue growing and dividing, when this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. 
The bone marrow produces immature cells that develop into leukemic white blood cells called lymphoblasts. 
These abnormal cells are unable to function properly, and they can build up and crowd out healthy cells.

It is important to mention that it is not clear what causes the DNA mutations that can lead to ALL.

### **B-cells**

B cell or B lymphocyte (bursa-derived cells) is a key player of the adaptive immune response that is responsible for humoral immunity in mammals.

### **STAT3 protein**

According to GeneCards human gene database, STAT3 (Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 3) is a Protein Coding gene. 
This protein is activated through phosphorylation in response to various cytokines and growth factors including IFNs, EGF, IL5, IL6, HGF, LIF and BMP2. 
This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli, and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis.


### **p53 gene**

According to National Cancer Institute (NCI), it is a gene that makes a protein that is found inside the nucleus of cells and plays a key role in controlling cell division and cell death. 
Mutations (changes) in the p53 gene may cause cancer cells to grow and spread in the body. 
These changes have been found in a genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome and in many types of cancer. The p53 gene is a type of tumor suppressor gene. 


### **Interaction between STAT3 and p53 gene**

Oncogenic signaling pathways inhibit the p53 gene transcription rate through a mechanism involving Stat3, which binds to the p53 promoter in vitro and in vivo. 
Site-specific mutation of a Stat3 DNA-binding site in the p53 promoter partially abrogates Stat3-induced inhibition. Stat3 activity also influences p53 response genes and affects UV-induced cell growth arrest in normal cells.
Furthermore, blocking Stat3 in cancer cells up-regulates expression of p53, leading to p53-mediated tumor cell apoptosis (Pham et al., 2020).
