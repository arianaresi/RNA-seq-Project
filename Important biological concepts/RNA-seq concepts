RNA-seq (RNA-sequencing) is a technique that can *examine the quantity and sequences of RNA* in a sample using next-generation sequencing (NGS). 
It analyzes the transcriptome, indicating which of the genes encoded in our DNA are turned on or off and to what extent (Mackenzie, R., 2018).


### **What is transcriptome?**

It is the set of all RNA molecules produced by the genome under specific conditions either in a specific cell (scRNA-Seq) or in a population of cells (bulk RNA-Seq).


### **Gene expression**

Gene expression is the *process by which the information encoded in a gene is turned into a function.* This mostly occurs via the transcription of RNA molecules that code for proteins or non-coding RNA molecules that serve other functions. 

Gene expression be thought of as an “on/off switch” to control when and where RNA molecules and proteins are made and as a “volume control” to determine how much of those products are made. The process of gene expression is carefully regulated, changing substantially under different conditions and cell types. 

The RNA and protein products of many genes serve to regulate the expression of other genes (NIH, 2024).


### **Why is it important to measure changes in gene expression (transcriptome)?**

- Variations in expression between conditions can be related to changes in biological processes.

- The transcriptome gives us an approximation of the relative changes in gene expression of coding and non-coding genes.


### **How can we study gene expression in sequencing data as students of genomic sciences?**
We can learn a lot from RNA-seq data obtained from previous studies on various research topics. Therefore, we utilized RNA-seq data acquired from the study conducted by Gasparoly, L., et al., titled `Susceptibility of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia to STAT3 inhibition depends on p53 induction`.
